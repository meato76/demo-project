Day 02  -- CI /CD

 - Review  --> https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVPUec-XE=/



 FREE TIER 

 	- It is free if you have only one server (750 hours)
 	- t2micro 
 	- 30 GB 
 	- 1 CPU + 1 GB 


 - Project --> https://github.com/mehmetCt/demo-project

	Q: Why we are using project from my repository ? 


	- In that repository we have 1 smoke 1 regression to make practice with Jenkins.Since  Jenkins machine has low performance (1 CPU , 1 GB RAM ), instead of waiting execution time  we can make more practice with that project 



--- HOMEWORK --- 

	Q: Are we gonna go through private git project?

	- I will publish short video about it.You can try by yourself.If you have any issue you can contact me 

	How to clone project in your local and push to github? 
		- Clone it in your local
		- Push to the your github repository 
		- Make it PRIVATE 
			- Settings 
			- Scroll bottom to DANGERZONE 
			- Select PRIVATE 
			- Follow short video 



 Q: What is Jenkins Job ? 

 	- DevOPs --> Manage CI / CD pipeline
 	- TESTER --> Schedule jobs 
 			- FirstProject - Smoke job 
 			- SecondProject - Regression job 
 

 Jenkins Jobs For Practice 




     ======= FREESTYLE PROJECTS  =======
 

 	1- first-project
 		  - cucumber report


 		  STEPS 
 		  1- New Item 
 		  2- My-first-project
 		  3- FreeStyle Project
 		  4- Click OK 

 		  	Configuration 

 		  		1- Source Code Management (SCM ) --> We need to put which project we need to run 
 		  										  https://github.com/mehmetCt/demo-project

 		  			with the help of JGit it will clone project into Jenkins Server Workspace to run 

 		  			- Branches to build
 		  				- We have master branch to run test.That is why we are not changing from here 

 		  		2- Build 
 		  		
 		  			- Click Dropdown
 		  			- Choose Invoke Top Level Maven Targets 
 		  			- Maven version 
 		  					- M3 
 		  					- Goals --> test (since it is already maven we dont need to emphasize mvn keyword)	



 		  			Q : How to run project into Jenkins ? 
 		  				With the hlep build we are using maven and maven lifecyle commands to run test cases 

 		  				it will trigger Runner class for executions 
 		  					<build>
						        <plugins>
						            <plugin>
						                <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
						                <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>
						                <version>3.0.0-M5</version>
						                <configuration>
						                  <!--  <parallel>methods</parallel>
						                    <threadCount>4</threadCount>-->
						                    <testFailureIgnore>true</testFailureIgnore>
						                    <includes>
						                        <include>**/*Runner.java</include>
						                    </includes>
						                </configuration>
						            </plugin>
						        </plugins>
						    </build>		

 		  		3- POST Build Actions 

 		  			- Cucumber Report 

 		  			To get Cucumber report cucumber plugin looking for any "**/*.json" plugin in your project
 		  			That is why we added 

 		  				"json:target/cucumber.json",

 		  				 plugin to get CUCUMBER REPORT 


 		  		4- Apply and SAVE 
 		  		
 		  		5- Build NOW !

    Q: How Jenkins works ? 
    
    - 		   

 	2- smoke-project 
 		  1- SCM 
 		  	- Git --> https://github.com/mehmetCt/demo-project


 		  How to add Build Trigger already existing project ? 

 		  	- Right click over project 
 		  	- Click configure 
 		  	- Click Build Triggers 
 		  	- Add schedule 
 		  	- Apply and SAVE 

 		  2- Build Triggers 

 		  		schedule with cron expression --> https://crontab.guru/


 		  		At 05:00 AM --> 0 5 * * *

 		  		H 5 * * * -> H will optimize Jenkins server performance to run around specified time 

 		  		Q: How to run at 2:15 everyday 

 		  			- 15 2 * * * 

 		  		Q: How can we schedule accordingto local time zone ? 
 		  		    - TZ=US/Eastern

 		  		
 		  		Q: Can we add more than one schedule  ? 
					- Yes  

 		  			- Schedule 
 		  				- each Sundays at 21:00

 		  				- each weekdays at 01:00     
 		  				
 		  			- Yes 
 						 TZ=US/Eastern
 						 0 1 * * 1-5 
 						 0 21 * * 0

 		  3- smoke 

 		  		- Click Build --> Invoke Top Level Maven Targets 
 		  		- M3
 		  		- Goals --> test -Dcucumber.filter.tags=@smoke

 		  4- cucumber report 

 		  		- Click Post Build Action 
 		  		- Click Cucumber Report 
 		  - Apply and SAVE 
 		  - Click Build Now 

 	3- regression-project
 		  - regression
 		  - cucumber report 
 		
 		1- SCM 
 		  	- Git --> https://github.com/mehmetCt/demo-project


 		2- Build Triggers 
 				- Build after other projects are built

 					my-smoke-project (trigger if the build stable )
  	

		3- regression 

 		  		- Click Build --> Invoke Top Level Maven Targets 
 		  		- M3
 		  		- Goals --> test -Dcucumber.filter.tags=@regression

 		4- cucumber report 

 		  		- Click Post Build Action 
 		  		- Click Cucumber Report 
 		  - Apply and SAVE 
 		  - Click Build Now 




 	NOTES : 
 		-- Build after other projects are built --

 		  	- if you wanna trigger regression after smoke test you can use this trigger option to do it 

 		  	  NOTE --> This is use case for CI.After getting Test Environment, we can schedule smoke , smoke will trigger regression for deployment process 


 		Q:if smoke will trigger regression, smoke  will run everyday is it going to trigger regression everyday?

 			Daily Smoke Job --> it is for daily executions 

 			DeploymentSmokeJob--> After this execution it will trigger regression 


 	Q: Why do we need to do all this in Jenkins? Whatâ€™s the point of running the smoke and regression on remote server?
		
 		-- Assume that you 15 feature for all regression.You are trying to run in your local parallelly
 		   How many browser will open ---> 15 






    ======= PIPELINES =======

    NOTE : You dont need to write pipeline scripts by yourself.It is written in Groovy Lang.We just need to know 
    what is structure and in some cases maybe we need to update related parts (repository or tags) 


    Difference between pipeline and freestyle projects ? 

    	Freestyle --> it is just simple jobs.We can add triggers to run jobs 
    	Pipeline --> it is for more complex jobs.There can many stages and maybe these stages needs to run paralell too 
    			     For the deploymeny process pipelince script will be written from DevOps

 	

 	4- smoke-project-pipeline-script
 		  - smoke 
 		  - cucumber report	 


 		  node {
			    stage('Clone code') {
			        git 'https://github.com/mehmetCt/demo-project.git'

			    }

			    stage('Run tests'){
			        if(isUnix()){
			            sh "mvn clean test"
			            /*
			            - sh refers shell commands
                        - Unix OS --> MacOS or Linux 
			            */
			        } else {
			            bat "mvn clean test -Dcucumber.filter.tags=\"@smoke\" "
			            //windows will use batch command
			        }

			    }

    Q :Do we need to push everything to github before running test in Jenkins?

    	- Yes . Jenkins will clone project from GITHUB for execution.

	Q: Can we run our project into Jenkins Server ? 

		- Yes 

		1- Make sure you have following plugin in Cukes Runner.Cucumber plugin from Jenkins will looking for **/*.json file to create report  

			 "json:target/cucumber.json",

	    2- Also you need to have maven-surefire-plugin to execute maven goals from Jenkins


	ERROR --> net.masterthought.cucumber.ValidationException: No JSON report file was found!

	How to fix ? 
		- Add plugin in CukesRunner

		 "json:target/cucumber.json",
